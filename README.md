## A Brief Intro to PyTorch for TechX 2020 Applied Deep Learning Course 

By: Chenglei Si 


### Get Started 

1. Download this repo. 
```
git clone https://github.com/NoviScl/PyTorch-Preview.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment. Follow [this page](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to see how to do it.

3. In your virtual environment, install PyTorch. Follow [this page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install it. I personally recommend using
```
pip3 install torch torchvision 
``` 
(I don't think there's a need to install the whole Anaconda for this course.)
You can check whether it's installed by entering Python, and type 
```
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
``` 
I recommend that you install a version >= 1.0.0
